still to do:

update Scalar Slepian functions "Instructions" with Alyssa's edits. Create new (more descriptive) images and/or add color bars.

possibly create Altitude-cognizant document explaining data inversion with potential field (not derivative) data.

possibly edit the HELP sections of rGscal and scalupderivative to add clarity.
